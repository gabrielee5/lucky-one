## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### "No deployment found"
```bash
Error: No deployment found for polygonAmoy. Please deploy first.
```
**Solution:** Deploy the contract first:
```bash
npm run deploy:amoy
```

#### "Insufficient balance"
```bash
Error: Insufficient balance. Need: 0.05 MATIC
```
**Solution:** Get MATIC from faucet:
- Polygon Amoy: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- Check balance: Look at command output

#### "Incorrect payment amount"
```bash
Error: Incorrect payment amount
```
**Solution:** Ensure exact payment (ticketCount √ó 0.01 MATIC):
```bash
# For 5 tickets: exactly 0.05 MATIC required
npm run buy-tickets:amoy -- --tickets=5
```

#### "Lottery has ended"
```bash
Error: Lottery has ended
```
**Solution:** Check current round and buy for active round:
```bash
npm run status:amoy  # Check current round
npm run buy-tickets:amoy -- --tickets=5  # Buy for current round
```

#### "Not the winner"
```bash
Error: Not the winner
```
**Solution:** Only winners can claim prizes:
```bash
npm run player-info:amoy  # Check your winning rounds
npm run claim-prize:amoy -- --round=N  # Claim from winning round
```

#### "VRF subscription issues"
**Solution:** Ensure VRF subscription has LINK:
```bash
npm run setup-vrf:amoy  # Follow VRF setup guide
```

### Gas Issues

#### High gas prices
- Use Polygon (lower fees than Ethereum)
- Wait for lower network congestion
- Polygon typically has stable, low fees

#### Transaction failures
- Ensure sufficient MATIC for gas
- Check network congestion
- Retry with higher gas limit if needed

### Network Issues

#### Wrong network
**Solution:** Ensure MetaMask is connected to correct network:
- Polygon Amoy: Chain ID 80002
- Polygon: Chain ID 137

#### RPC issues
**Solution:** Check `.env` file for correct RPC URLs:
```env
POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Always check status first:** `npm run status:amoy`
2. **Test with small amounts:** Start with 1-2 tickets
3. **Monitor gas costs:** Commands show estimated gas usage
4. **Keep VRF funded:** Ensure LINK balance for winner selection
5. **Claim prizes promptly:** No expiration, but good practice
6. **Use testnet first:** Test on Amoy before mainnet
