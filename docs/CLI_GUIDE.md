## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### "No deployment found"
```bash
Error: No deployment found for polygon. Please deploy first.
```
**Solution:** Use setup-existing-contract or deploy:
```bash
npm run setup-existing-contract -- --network=polygon
# OR deploy new contract
npm run deploy
```

#### "Insufficient balance"
```bash
Error: Insufficient balance. Need: 0.05 POL
```
**Solution:** Get POL tokens:
- Polygon Mainnet: Purchase POL on exchanges
- Polygon Amoy (testnet): https://faucet.polygon.technology/
- Check balance: Look at command output

#### "Incorrect payment amount"
```bash
Error: Incorrect payment amount
```
**Solution:** Ensure exact payment (ticketCount √ó 10 POL):
```bash
# For 5 tickets: exactly 50 POL required
TICKETS=5 npm run buy-tickets
```

#### "Lottery has ended"
```bash
Error: Lottery has ended
```
**Solution:** Check current round and buy for active round:
```bash
npm run status  # Check current round
TICKETS=5 npm run buy-tickets  # Buy for current round
```

#### "Not the winner"
```bash
Error: Not the winner
```
**Solution:** Only winners can claim prizes:
```bash
npm run player-info  # Check your winning rounds
ROUND=N npm run claim-prize  # Claim from winning round
```

#### "VRF subscription issues"
**Solution:** Ensure VRF subscription has LINK:
```bash
npm run setup-vrf  # Follow VRF setup guide
```

### Gas Issues

#### High gas prices
- Polygon mainnet has very low fees compared to Ethereum
- Wait for lower network congestion if needed
- POL transactions are typically under $0.01

#### Transaction failures
- Ensure sufficient POL for gas
- Check network congestion
- Retry with higher gas limit if needed

### Network Issues

#### Wrong network
**Solution:** Ensure MetaMask is connected to correct network:
- Polygon Mainnet: Chain ID 137 (default)
- Polygon Amoy: Chain ID 80002 (for testing)

#### RPC issues
**Solution:** Check `.env` file for correct RPC URLs:
```env
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com/
POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Always check status first:** `npm run status`
2. **Test with small amounts:** Start with 1-2 tickets
3. **Monitor gas costs:** Commands show estimated gas usage
4. **Keep VRF funded:** Ensure LINK balance for winner selection
5. **Claim prizes promptly:** No expiration, but good practice
6. **Use testnet for testing:** `npm run setup-existing-contract -- --network=polygonAmoy`
