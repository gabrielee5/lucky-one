NETWORKS: {
  polygonAmoy: {
    chainId: 80002,
    name: "Polygon Amoy",
    rpcUrl: "https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/",
    blockExplorer: "https://amoy.polygonscan.com",
    currency: "MATIC",
    contractAddress: "0xaE3214F7b7ba132FEE0227F0a6828018Db8d83E9"
  },
  polygon: {
    chainId: 137,
    name: "Polygon",
    rpcUrl: "https://polygon-rpc.com/",
    blockExplorer: "https://polygonscan.com",
    currency: "MATIC"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MetaMask Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
   - Add Polygon Amoy network to MetaMask
   - Check network configuration (Chain ID: 80002)

2. **Transaction Failures**:
   - Check account balance for MATIC gas fees
   - Verify correct network selection (Polygon Amoy)
   - Ensure lottery is still open

3. **Contract Interaction Errors**:
   - Verify contract address: `0xaE3214F7b7ba132FEE0227F0a6828018Db8d83E9`
   - Check if you're on Polygon Amoy network
   - Confirm ABI is up to date

### Development Tips

- Use `npm run status:amoy` to check current lottery status
- Check Polygonscan for transaction details
- Test with small amounts first
- Use the status dashboard for real-time monitoring

## Gas Costs (Polygon vs Ethereum)

| Operation | Ethereum | Polygon | Savings |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| Deploy Contract | ~0.1 ETH | ~0.06 MATIC | ~90% |
| Buy Tickets | ~0.01 ETH | ~0.005 MATIC | ~95% |
| End Lottery | ~0.008 ETH | ~0.004 MATIC | ~90% |
| Withdraw Fees | ~0.005 ETH | ~0.001 MATIC | ~95% |

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes**:

- This is a demonstration project - audit before mainnet deployment
- Always verify contract addresses before interacting
- Never share private keys or seed phrases
- Understand the risks of smart contract interactions
- Consider gas costs and transaction fees
- **Owner fee system is transparent and auditable**

## Revenue Model

The 5% fee system provides a sustainable revenue model:
- **5% of ticket sales** automatically retained as owner fees
- **95% of ticket sales** goes to prize pool
- **Transparent fee tracking** with public withdrawal functions
- **No hidden fees** - all transactions are on-chain
