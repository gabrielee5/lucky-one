### Option 1: Use the setup script (coming soon)
```bash
npm run setup-existing-contract
```

### Option 2: Manual setup
1. Create the deployments directory:
```bash
mkdir -p packages/cli/deployments
```

2. Create the Amoy deployment file:
```bash
cat > packages/cli/deployments/polygonAmoy.json << 'EOF'
{
  "network": "polygonAmoy",
  "lotteryAddress": "0xaE3214F7b7ba132FEE0227F0a6828018Db8d83E9",

3. Test the connection:
```bash
npm run status:amoy
```

## üéØ How to Use

Once set up, you can immediately start interacting:

```bash
# Check lottery status
npm run status:amoy

# Buy tickets
npm run buy-tickets:amoy -- --tickets=5

# Check your player info
npm run player-info:amoy

# End lottery (when time expires)
npm run end-lottery:amoy

# Claim prizes (if you win)
npm run claim-prize:amoy -- --round=1
```

## üîÑ Updating Contract Addresses

When new contracts are deployed or networks are added, this file will be updated. Check the latest version for current addresses.

### How to Deploy Your Own Instance

If you want to deploy your own lottery contract instead of using the existing one:

1. Set up your environment variables in `.env`
2. Deploy to your chosen network:
```bash
npm run deploy:amoy
```
3. Your deployment will create a new contract and update your local deployment files
