# LuckyOne - Decentralized Lottery

A provably fair decentralized lottery system built with Solidity, React, and Chainlink VRF v2.

## 🎯 Current Status

**✅ LIVE ON POLYGON MAINNET**
- **Contract**: `0x65C7F3cB0F1DA3d7566e28d49F995c30d5F75ec0`
- **Network**: Polygon Mainnet (Chain ID: 137)
- **Ticket Price**: 10 POL per ticket
- **Lottery Duration**: 24 hours per round

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- MetaMask wallet
- POL tokens for ticket purchases

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd lottery
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd packages/app && npm install
```

### Usage

#### Web Application
```bash
npm run app
```
Then visit http://localhost:5173 and connect your MetaMask wallet.

#### CLI Commands
```bash
# Check lottery status
npm run status

# Buy tickets (example: 5 tickets)
TICKETS=5 npm run buy-tickets

# Claim prize (if you won round 1)
npm run claim-prize

# Check your participation
ADDRESS=0xfadoe34j3rh... npm run player-info
```

## 🎰 How It Works

### Lottery Mechanics
- **Ticket Sales**: Purchase 1-100 tickets per transaction
- **Fair Selection**: Chainlink VRF ensures provably random winner selection
- **Auto Rounds**: Everyone can end the round and the next one start automatically
- **Prize Pool**: Winner receives the accumulated ticket sales (minus fees)

### Progressive Fee Structure
- **First 100 tickets**: 0% fee
- **Tickets 101-1000**: 2.5% fee
- **Tickets 1001+**: 5% fee

Fees are deducted when prizes are claimed, keeping the system transparent.
